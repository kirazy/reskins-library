--- Provides methods for getting sprites for belt-type entities.
---
---### Examples
---```lua
---local _belts = require("__reskins-library__.api.sprites.belts")
---```
---@class Reskins.Lib.Sprites.Belts
local _belts = {}

---
---Gets the belt animation set for the given `belt_sprites`, tinted with the given `tint`.
---
---### Returns 
---@return data.TransportBeltAnimationSet # A tinted belt animation set.
---
---### Examples
---```lua
----- Get the belt animation set for a slow belt, colored with a red tint.
---local tint = util.color("#ff0000")
---local belt_animation_set = _belts.get_belt_animation_set(_defines.belt_sprites.standard, tint)
---
----- Set it on the transport belt prototype.
---local belt = data.raw["transport-belt"]["transport-belt"]
---belt.belt_animation_set = belt_animation_set
---```
---
---### Parameters
---@param belt_sprites Reskins.Lib.Defines.BeltSprites # The type of belt animation set to get.
---@param tint data.Color # The tint to apply to the belt animation set.
---
---### Exceptions
---*@throws* `string` â€” Thrown when `belt_sprites` is an unsupported type.
